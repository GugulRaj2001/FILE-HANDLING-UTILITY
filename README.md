*DOMAIN*  : JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION* : 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*  : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

# TASK DESCRIPTION :
*Overview of the Task* :
As part of my internship, I was assigned the task of developing a Java-based file handling utility that performs essential file operations,
including reading, writing, and modifying text files. The goal of this task was to create a simple yet efficient Java program that can manipulate text files using standard Java I/O techniques.

The program is structured in a single-class format, ensuring all file operations are implemented in a single Java file. This makes the program easy to understand, execute, and modify when necessary. 
By implementing this task, I have demonstrated my ability to work with file handling operations and gained hands-on experience with Java‚Äôs BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, FileWriter,
and Java NIO (Paths & Files).

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used :
‚úÖ Java (JDK 8 or later)
‚úÖ BufferedReader & BufferedWriter for efficient I/O operations
‚úÖ FileReader & FileWriter for file access
‚úÖ NIO (Files and Paths) for modifying file content

# Features :
‚úÖ Write to File: Saves predefined content to a text file, ensuring the initial data is stored correctly.
‚úÖ Read from File: Retrieves and displays the file‚Äôs contents to the console.
‚úÖ Modify File: Allows users to modify specific text within the file by replacing existing content.

# üöÄ Which Editor Used : *Eclipse*
