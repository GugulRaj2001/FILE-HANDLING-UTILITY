# FILE HANDLING UTILITY

*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*    : RAJKUMAR GUGULOTH

*INTERN ID* : CT06WC118

*DOMAIN*  : JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION* : 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*  : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

# TASK DESCRIPTION:
*Overview of the Task* :
As part of my internship, I was assigned the task of developing a Java-based file handling utility that performs essential file operations,
including reading, writing, and modifying text files. The goal of this task was to create a simple yet efficient Java program that can manipulate text files using standard Java I/O techniques.

The program is structured in a single-class format, ensuring all file operations are implemented in a single Java file. This makes the program easy to understand, execute, and modify when necessary. 
By implementing this task, I have demonstrated my ability to work with file handling operations and gained hands-on experience with Java’s BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, FileWriter,
and Java NIO (Paths & Files).

# 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used:
✅ Java (JDK 8 or later)

✅ BufferedReader & BufferedWriter for efficient I/O operations

✅ FileReader & FileWriter for file access

✅ NIO (Files and Paths) for modifying file content

# Features:
✅ Write to File: Saves predefined content to a text file, ensuring the initial data is stored correctly.

✅ Read from File: Retrieves and displays the file’s contents to the console.

✅ Modify File: Allows users to modify specific text within the file by replacing existing content.

# 🚀 Which Editor Used: 

*Eclipse*

# Task Execution:

# 1. Writing to a File:

==> Created a Java program that writes predefined content to a text file "(CodTech_IT_Solutions.txt)".
==> Used "BufferedWriter" and "FileWriter" to ensure efficient writing operations.
 
# 2. Reading from a File:

==> Implemented a method to read and display the contents of the text file.
==> Used "BufferedReader" and "FileReader" for reading data efficiently.
==> Ensured that the program handles file not found and other exceptions gracefully.

# 3. Modifying File Content:

==> Implemented a method that searches for a specific word or phrase and replaces it with new text.
==> Used Paths and Files."readAllBytes()" to read the file content into a string.
==> Applied "replace()" method to modify specific words and then wrote the updated content back to the file.


# O/P OF PROGRAM:

==> File written successfully.
